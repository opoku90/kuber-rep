#
# Create the pod which has tolerance for color pink
#
# Create namespace geolocation -
# kubectl create namespace geolocation
#
# Run the pod
# kubectl create -f pod-with-taint.yml
#
# Check the pod
# kubectl get pods --namespace=geolocation
# (it should be running on nodeone.example.com)
# (because of taint and toleration)
#
# Remember: taint & tolerance is only for restricting
# nodes to ACCEPT only certain kind of pods. So,
# our pod can also go to other nodes, which are 
# NEUTRAL to taint (fragrance). But, nodeone.example.com
# will accept ONLY those pods which have pink taint (fragrance)
#
# Delete pod
# kubectl delete pod/webserver --namespace=geolocation
#
# Delete the taints from the nodes:
# kubectl taint node nodeone.example.com color:NoSchedule-
# kubectl taint node nodetwo.example.com color:NoSchedule-
#
# Describe the node master.example.com and understand
# why a pod is never assigned for master.example.com
# kubectl describe node master.example.com
